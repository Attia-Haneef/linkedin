Explanation:

The refactored code is concise and clear.

We begin by importing the necessary modules and classes from Django. In this case, we need to import the `admin` module from `django.contrib` and the `Job` model from `myapp.models`.

Next, we register the `Job` model with the admin site using the `admin.site.register()` method. This allows us to view and manage `Job` objects through the Django admin interface.

By breaking down the code into two simple steps and providing comments, the refactored code becomes more readable and easier to understand.
